This Java program utilizes the Swing GUI widget toolkit to create a fully functioning chess game with its own GUI.
Its functionalities include:
* Checking if a piece is moving correctly (Moves like castling and En Passant are incorporated)
* Preventing a move that would result in the player's king being in check
* Only allowing moves that would get the player's king out of check if they started the turn in check
* Pawn Promotion (With its own built-in GUI)
* Detects if a player has no more valid moves to declare a winner
